## Introduction

The goal of this project is to classify resumes into specific categories based on their domains using the SVM machine learning algorithm. This can be particularly useful for sorting and organizing resumes for efficient recruitment processes.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-resume-classification-repo.git
Install the required dependencies if any using:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Open the project in Spyder IDE.

Make sure you have your dataset prepared and saved in the required format.

Run the script svm_classification.py to train the SVM model and perform resume classification.

Review the generated results and model evaluation metrics.

Features
SVM-based classification of resumes into domain-specific categories.
Data preprocessing using various techniques such as text cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction.
Model evaluation using classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
